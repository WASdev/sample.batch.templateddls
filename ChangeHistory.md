# Change History

Each move to a newer level of the 2015 monthly betas should be accompanied by dropping and recreating new batch persistence tables (perhaps using the new auto-create capabilities).  

## Update: 2015-05-22

### 2015-May Beta


* Removed DDL templates.   

* Updated project documentation to mention that the DDL templates are no longer up to date, and to explain the ability to rely on auto-creation of DB tables.
